NIFLib.dll
----------

a) base
 filenames starting with "NIFLib" implements the dll interface.
 
 At first there where only niflib.cpp. Later on I started to split these things in differnt files.

b) Chunks
    "CNode" and all "CNi..." files.
    
    CNode is the base class of all CNi-Classes.
    A CNi.. class represent a chunk of a nif-file.
    
    After loading these nodes are organized in a tree structure.
    One main-node is CNiNode (transform matrix).
    The meshdata itself are in CNiTriShapeData or CNiTriStripData.
    All others are effects, animation, texturing,....

    for further documentations see: CNode.h

  
c) Helpers
   
    c1) File-access
        CDirList    - reading directorys and mpk-files
        CNiStream   - stream for nif-files
        CReaderINI  - reading and parsing '.ini' files 
        CReaderCSV  - reading and parsing '.csv' files
        
    c2) Grafics
        CVector         - Vector class
        CMatrix         - Matrix class
        CTextureManager - singleton class, managing textures
        
    c3) others
        Tarray.h    - an array-template, just to be independend :)
        CChilds     - load and convert indiezes to pointers. Only used by chunk-classes
        bitmaps     - texture-not-found and icon's for the debug-window

        
d) Debug
  "CDebug*" files and "debug_log" are mainly for debugging.
  These are the object-tree, loadingbar (is used in release also) and standard logging functions.
