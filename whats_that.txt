 NIFLib
 ------
   source of niflib.dll
   
   Generates: /bin/niflib.dll  (or /bin/niflib_dbg.dll)
 	
   A short file description text is in there, but most documentation is done inside the code.
   Use doxygen to generate a rough overview.
   
 
 ZLib
 -----
   http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
   
   Must be linked with NIFLib.
   MPK files are compressed so zlib is needed to read that files.
     
 
 NIFLib_ExampleFrameWork
 -----------------------
 	a example framework.
 	That's just my c# test framework.
 	Since I don't use it by myself the handling can be improved alot.
 	You'll have to copy the niflib.dll into it by hand.
 	(if you want debug informations use the niflib_dbg.dll and rename it to niflib.dll)
